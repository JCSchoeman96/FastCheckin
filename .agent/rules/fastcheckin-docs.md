When adding new mobile API endpoints, update or propose updates to API documentation (even if it’s just an internal markdown file).

Every new module (backend or frontend) must include a short header comment describing its purpose in the FastCheckin architecture.

When you add or change behaviour that affects operators (e.g. new scan rules, new error messages), mention that documentation or training material might need updating.
