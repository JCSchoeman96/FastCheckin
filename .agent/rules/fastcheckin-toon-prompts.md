This workspace is driven by TOON prompts (Task, Objective, Output, Note).

When responding to a TOON-style request, only perform the single task described in the Task field. Do not anticipate later steps.

Only touch the files listed in the Output field, unless there is a strong technical reason to touch another file (which must be explicitly explained).

If the TOON prompt is underspecified or conflicts with existing architecture, highlight the issue and propose follow-up work instead of guessing.
